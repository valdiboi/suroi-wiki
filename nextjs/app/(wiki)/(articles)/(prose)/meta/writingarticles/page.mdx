# Writing Articles

First of all, thanks for helping out with the documentation! Since this wiki is community-run, we need all the help we can get.
Since this wiki is a custom coded solution, creating articles is a bit different to what you might be used to over on Fandom.

Articles are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/), an extension of the typical Markdown you may be used to.

# Style Guide

When writing an article for an object in the game, please follow the layout below. If in doubt, consult an existing 
article (e.g., [AK47](/weapons/guns/ak47)).

## Article Layout

## General Pointers
- Articles should be written in American English (e.g. color rather than colo**u**r)

# Syntax

See the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/) docs for a detailed overview of MDX. If you are new to Markdown, you can find a
guide [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

There are a few special syntax rules.

1. Use `<Image src="https://example.com/image.png" height={128} width={128} alt="A placeholder image" />` when inserting images. This is because Next.js
   (the software used to render the wiki) can optimise images for faster loading when using this special tag.

## Extensions

There are a couple MDX/JSX tags you can use to make your articles more interactive. They are listed below for your reference.

### `<Event />`

Shows a small banner at the top of the page like the one on the [USAS-12 Article](/weapons/guns/usas12) notifying readers
that this item is only available in a specific event. See below:

<Event />

### `<CommitLink sha="" />`

Shows a link to a commit on the GitHub repo. Useful for linking to the commit that introduced a feature.

- **sha** The SHA1 hash of the commit. Can be shortened to 7 characters.

```md
This vest used to be called the "Bulletproof Vest" until it was updated in <CommitLink sha="1da8f75e"/>. **#bringbackbulletproofvest**
```

### `<TimeLink time={1699868632020} />`

Shows a link to a specific time. Adjusts to the user's timezone. Clicking on it copies the ISO 8601 timestamp to the clipboard, and hovering shows it.
See below:

<TimeLink time={1699868632020} />

- **time** Unix milliseconds, UTC of course

```md
The example used above is: <TimeLink date={1699868632020}/>
```

### `<RemovedItem />`

<Removed/>
