The **M16A4** is a burst-fire assault rifle utilizing 5.56mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.5.0 "Locked & Loaded" update on June 24, 2023.

# Background
The M16 series of rifles is based off of the larger AR-10 series of rifles, both designed by Eugene Stoner in the late 1950s. It replaced the heavier M14 rifle as the primary infantry rifle and was designed around the brand-new 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge. The M16 family of rifles and its variants see use in many militaries, police, and security forces around the globe.

# Strategies
# Using
- The M16 is currently one of the strongest weapons in the game due to its quick fire rate.
- The burst feature allows you to output high amounts of damage and recede quickly, which means the M16A4 can stand up to autos like the [MCX Spear](weapons/guns/mcx_spear).
- Make use of prediction and tracking to the best of your ability, especially at longer ranges.
- Pair this weapon with a shotgun for high kills.

# Countering
- Hide behind cover and take short opportunities to chip away at the opponent's health.
- If approaching, make sure that you strafe as much as you can to throw off your opponent's shots.
  - Once at close range, use a high-DPS weapon like a shotgun or SMG to kill the M16A4 user.

# Obtaining
- The M16 is a rare weapon, being as rare as the [ARX-160](/weapons/guns/arx160), [MCX Spear](/weapons/guns/mcx_spear) and the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues).

# Trivia
- There are currently 8 million M16s in the world
- Eugene Stoner also designed the [SR-25](/weapons/guns/sr25) and the [Stoner 63](/weapons/guns/stoner_63)
