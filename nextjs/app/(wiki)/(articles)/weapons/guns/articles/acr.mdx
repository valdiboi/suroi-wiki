The **Remington Arms Adaptive Combat Rifle**, known in-game as the **ACR**, is a supressed assault rifle utilizing 5.56mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.13.0 "Terminal Velocity" update on November 27th, 2023. It has decent accuracy, high damage, and excellent DPS.

# Background
The ACR was designed by Magpul Industries in the early 2000s, and was essentially a melting pot of many existing assault rifle designs. It was initially known as the "Masada", but after the design was licensed to Bushmaster Arms in 2008, the name became Adaptive Combat Rifle, or ACR. Remington Arms designed and produced the select-fire military variant, while Bushmaster made the semi-automatic civilian version. Although the ACR was entered into the Army's Individual Carbine competition (to replace the M4 carbine), the competition was cancelled. The ACR has only ever seen semi-established service in the hands of the Polish SSW.

# Strategies
## Using
- The ACR has similar accuracy to the [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47), so make sure to get a 4x or 8x scope to take advantage of the accuracy.
- If an opponent hides behind destructible cover such as trees, keep shooting. The ACR has an incredible 300 DPS to obstacles, and will instantly shred it and kill your opponent.
- Don't be afraid to get in a fight against other high-DPS assault rifles and SMGs, as you have more DPS than them.
    - However watch out at close-range as shotguns are still dangerous.
- Pair the ACR with a shotgun for a combo with exceedingly high DPS. Weaken your opponent with one and use the other to finsh them off.

# Countering
- At long range, snipers and DMRs will be more accurate than the ACR and have higher effective DPS (for DMRs).
- At close-range, you can use a shotgun for to try and take out an ACR user.
- The ACR destroys cover very easily, but if there is a lot of cover you can waste your opponent's ammo by moving between different pieces of cover.
    - Indestructible cover such as oil tanks is much better for stalling against an ACR user.

# Obtaining
- The only way to get the ACR is to either find one in a gold airdrop or from breaking a Flint stone.

# Trivia
- The ACR in Suroi is a 10.5" carbine variant with an attached supressor
