The **Beretta ARX160**, known in-game as the **ARX-160** or simply the **ARX** is an assault rifle utilizing 7.62mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.10.0 "Back with a Bang" update on September 14th, 2023.

# Background
The ARX160 was developed for the Italian Armed Forces in 2008. It is available in both 7.62x39mm and 5.56x45mm NATO, and is a fully modular assault rifle. The ARX160 is used by a variety of police and special military forces around the world.

# Strategies
## Using
- The ARX-160 is one of the best automatic weapons in mid-to-short range, with the high rate of fire and decent damage giving it a high DPS.
  - Be careful against opponents with longer range weapons, because the ARX-160 is inaccurate at long range.
- The ARX-160 is a direct upgrade to the the [AUG](/weapons/guns/aug), and has more DPS than the [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47).

## Countering
- The ARX-160's high spread makes it have a low effective range. Therefore, a more accurate assault rifle, DMR, or sniper can be used against an opponent with an ARX-160.
- If you are caught up close against someone using the ARX-160, try using a SMG like the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) or a shotgun.
- Hide behind indestructible obstacles such as containers and oil tanks.
- LMGs are also effective against the ARX-160, especially at longer ranges.

# Obtaining
The ARX-160 is relatively common in higher-tier crates such as the A.E.G.I.S. crate. It can also be found uncommonly as world loot.

# Trivia
- In real-life, the ARX160 can be converted to 7.62x39mm using a conversion kit
