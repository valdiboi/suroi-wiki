<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>The goal of Suroi is to be the last player standing. You'll start with nothing, so move around the map to get weapons, scopes, armor, healing items, and ammo. If you see another player, eliminate them for their loot!</p>

<h2>Orange = Bad</h2>
<p>You have another enemy to watch out for: a deadly orange gas. The gas slowly fills the map as the game progresses, making the safe zone smaller and smaller. The damage increases each time it shrinks.</p>

<h2>Similar Games</h2>
<p>If you've played games like PUBG, Fortnite, and Apex Legends, or other browser battle royales like surviv.io and zombsroyale.io, you might be familiar with the concept of the game!</p>
