## Writing

Before writing there are guidelines you have to agree to if you want your writing to be on the wiki:

### Do
- Write correct and accurate information
- Use your own words
- Follow the conventions that other articles use

### Don't
- Copy and paste from Wikipedia or other sources! Paraphrase what you learned
- Submit incorrect and inaccurate information. The maintainers of this wiki know the game well enough that it isn't true (that there are AI players in the game)
- Write strategies if you are new/inexperienced in the game

### Writing an article
1. Get a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/signup) if you haven't gotten one
2. Create a fork of the wiki [here](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi-wiki/fork)
3. The `src/content/` directory is where you can find written content
4. Edit the wiki using **MDX**, an extended version of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
5. Create a pull request

## Developing

This wiki uses [Astro](https://astro.build), and uses [React](https://react.dev) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) for writing components. We also use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to style the wiki
