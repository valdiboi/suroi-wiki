The Level 2 Pack is the second-best backpack in the game.

# Trivia
- This pack used to be called the Regular Backpack but was renamed in <CommitLink sha="1da8f75e"/>. **#revert1da8f75e**
- The texture for this pack actually has a very small Flint logo on it (top left black rectangle), but it is usually too small to see in game.
