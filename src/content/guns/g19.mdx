Glock variants are in use all over the globe in police, military, and other security forces.

# Strategies 
## Using
- Due to the G19's low accuracy, try and get close to your opponent so you can hit your shots.
- Spam click the G19 to achieve the maximum DPS.
  - The G19 can be an effective tool early game against players with no armor or weaker Leve1 1 armor.
