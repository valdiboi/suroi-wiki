The **Ruger Mini-14**, known in-game as the **Mini-14**, is a DMR utilizing 5.56mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.10.0 "Back with a Bang" update on September 14th, 2023. It has decent damage, a high rate of fire, and high DPS.

# Background
The Mini-14, as the name suggests, is based on the bigger 7.62x51mm NATO firing M14. It uses a custom gas design but fires the smaller 5.56x45mm NATO or .223 Remington cartridge. Variants chambered for other calibers such as 7.62x39mm also exist. The Mini-14 was popular with police forces in the United States for many years before being largely replaced by M4-style rifles. It is still in use in a variety of police and security forces worldwide.

# Strategies
## Using
- The Mini-14 is best used at long-range, but its high DPS makes it effective against many weapons at mid-range as well.
- Stay at long range, as the high accuracy and fast bullet speed make the Mini-14 very powerful against other long-range weapons like snipers and the [MCX Spear](weapons/guns/mcx_spear)
- The SR-25 has more damage than the Mini-14 albieit at the cost of a slightly lower DPS.
- Pair the Mini-14 with a high-DPS shotgun or SMG for close-range combat.

## Countering
- Use high adrenaline and strafe the Mini-14 user, as the low spread makes it easier to dodge the bullets.
- Despite the Mini-14 having very good obstacle DPS, you can still use cover like rocks and trees as a last resort to waste the opponent's ammo, and attack while they are reloading.
- High-DPS weapons such as SMGs and shotguns can beat the Mini-14 at close range.
  - Hide around indestructible obstacles such as oil tanks or in buildings to force the Mini-14 user into close-range combat.
  - Be careful, however, as they might have a shotgun or SMG of their own as a secondary weapon.
- At long-range, snipers can be effective against the Mini-14, provided that you quickswitch to move around quicker. 
- The [MCX Spear](weapons/guns/mcx_spear) has a higher DPS and comparable accuracy to the Mini-14, and can be used as a counter.

# Obtaining
The Mini-14 can be found rarely as world loot but is more common in rare drops such as from A.E.G.I.S. and Flint crates, or from the center of a warehouse.

# Trivia
- The reference image for the Mini-14 is one of the developer's own Mini-14
- The in-game Mini-14 is most likely the "Ranch" variant, which is the most basic configuration
