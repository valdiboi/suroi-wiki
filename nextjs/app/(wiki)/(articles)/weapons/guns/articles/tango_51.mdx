The **Tactical Operations Tango 51**, known in-game as the **Tango 51**, is a bolt-actio sniper rifle utilizing 7.62mm ammunition. It was added in the v0.5.0 "Locked & Loaded" on June 24, 2023. It features very high damage and accuracy.

# Background
The Tango 51 is a tactical sniper rifle designed and manufactured by Tactical Operations in the 1990's. It was designed to be a lightweight, compact weapon and for use by law enforcement snipers. In testing, it had incredible accuracy, and comes guaranteed with a .25" MOA.

# Strategies
## Using
- Take advantage of the high accuracy, speed, and damage and snipe enemies from a distance. 
  - If you are skilled enough, it can be used in close range, though this can be dangerous if your opponent possesses a high dps weapon such as a shotgun.
- Keep your distance by running away while shooting + quickswitching if your opponent decides to rush. 
  - Make sure to quickswitch as the speed reduction after a shot can be just enough time for your opponent to gun you down and kill you.
- Don't be overconfident. While it may seem that you are unstoppable with such a powerful weapon, enemies can still catch you by surprise.

## Countering
- Don't rush your opponent directly if you plan on attacking close-range as it makes you an easy shot. Instead, strategically move around obstacles and strafe in open spaces to minimize the number of shots your opponent hits.
- If you have another sniper rifle such as the [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin), it can be used for a long range fight between you and your opponent. Be aware that the Tango deals a lot of damage, so hide behind obstacles and strafe whenever possible.

# Obtaining
The most reliable way to get a Tango 51 is to head for the ship on the docks structure during the beginning of the game. After collecting the [Gas Can] (/weapons/melee/gas_can) on the ship, use the generator to open the vault. There will either be a crate that contains up to two Tango 51's or an A.E.G.I.S. crate. The Tango 51 can also be found extremely rarely from common sources.

# Trivia
- The real-life Tango 51 is actually based on the action of a Remington 700.
  - However it is custom-made and far more precise than a standard Remington one.
