## Writing

Before writing there are guidelines you have to agree to if you want your writing to be on the wiki:

### Do
- Write correct and accurate information
- Use your own words
- Follow the conventions that other articles use

### Don't
- Copy and paste from Wikipedia or other sources! Paraphrase what you learned
- Submit incorrect and inaccurate information. The maintainers of this wiki know the game well enough that it isn't true (that there are AI players in the game)
- Write strategies if you are new/inexperienced in the game

### Writing an article
1. Get a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/signup) if you haven't gotten one
2. Create a fork of the wiki [here](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi-wiki/fork)
3. The `src/content/` directory is where you can find written content
4. Edit the wiki using **MDX**, an extended version of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
5. To add special components to your article, see the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#using-components-in-mdx)
6. Create a pull request


### Writing a community page

It is the same as [writing an article](#writing-an-article), but there is required frontmatter,

```markdown
---
title: "Your title here"
tags: [ "Put", "Really", "Cool", "Tags", "Here" ]
author: "Your name"
published: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

Note that `published` is the date it was first published and `updated` is the date it was last updated

Common tags are:

- `Guide`
- `Hosting`
- `Mod`
- `Showcase`

In order for your page to be on the wiki, it has to be:

- Related to Suroi
- Has accurate information
- Original
- Safe and respectful
- Not an advertisement (unless it is a mod)

## Developing

This wiki uses [Astro](https://astro.build), and uses [React](https://react.dev) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) for writing components. We also use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to style the wiki
