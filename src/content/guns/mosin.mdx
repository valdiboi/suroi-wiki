The **Mosin-Nagant** is a bolt-action sniper rifle utilizing 7.62mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.4.0 "Supplies received" update on June 17th, 2023.

# Background
The Mosin-Nagant was designed in 1891 by Captain Sergei Mosin and Émile Nagant for the Russian Empire. It saw the introduction of the popular 7.62x54mmR cartridge. Despite its old age, the rifle has seen use in a multitude of conflicts and is still in active service in some areas.

# Strategies
## Using
- Avoid close range engagements as much as you can
- Against assault rifles and DMRs, use cover to force your opponent to waste ammo. Against shotguns, playing around cover isn't essential if you outrange them.

## Countering
- Hide behind obstacles and try to lure the Mosin user closer to you using the zone or other players. When you are close enough, attack with a high DPS weapon.
- Shotguns are effective against the Mosin at close range for the simple reason that their damage output is better.

# Obtaining
The Mosin-Nagant is an uncommon drop from higher-tier crates such as the A.E.G.I.S crate. It can also be found rarely as world loot.

# Trivia
- Émile Nagant's brother, Léon Nagant, designed the [M1895](/weapons/guns/m1895) revolver
