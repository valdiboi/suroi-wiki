The **Nagant M1895 Revolver**, known in-game as the **M1895**, is a pistol utilizing 7.62mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.11.0 "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023.

# Background
The M1895 was designed by the Belgian Léon Nagant for the Russian Empire. It is notable for its use of a special "gas-seal" system, which boosted the muzzle velocity, allowed it to be suppressed, and eliminated finger injuries. However, this came at the cost of reload time, both ejecting and reloading the cartridges. The M1895 was widely used in both Russian and Soviet forces up until it was officially replaced by the Makarov pistol in 1952. It continued to see use in Russia officially as late as 2009.
