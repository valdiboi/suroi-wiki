The **Glock 19**, known in-game as the G19, is a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. It was added to the game in the v0.4.0 "Supplies received" update on June 17th, 2023.

# Background
The Glock 19 is a "Compact" version of the Glock 17. It carries fifteen rounds in comparison to the Glock 17's seventeen rounds. The Glock series was the first commerically successful polymer framed pistol. It is famed for its reliability and low cost. Glock variants are in use all over the globe in police, military, and other security forces.

# Strategies 
## Using
- It is recommended to swap this weapon out for almost anything else, as it is significantly outclassed by other weapons in almost every situation.

## Countering
- Due to the G19 having low stats, it is relatively easy to counter. Stay at a medium distance and gun them down or out-dps them by rushing.

# Obtaining
The G19 is a very common weapon that can be found almost anywhere. It usually spawns from low-tier loot sources such as crates.

# Trivia
- The G19 is named "G19" instead of "Glock 19" due to copyright concerns
- Before v0.9.0, the G19 was fully automatic instead of semi-automatic as it is in real life
  - This would imply that it had a "switch" on it
