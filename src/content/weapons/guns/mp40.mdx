The **MP 40 (Maschinenpistole 40)**, known in-game as the **MP40**, is a SMG utilizing 9mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.8.0 "Untrodden Lands" update on July 17th, 2023. It has decent DPS and very good accuracy for a SMG.

# Background
THe MP 40 was designed by Heinrich Vollmer, taking inspiration from the MP 38. It was essentially a simplified version using stamped steel instead of machined parts. Thus, it was cheap to produce and was used by the Axis powers as a paratrooper weapon as well as a sidearm for armored vehicles. The MP 40 itself was fairly reliable, but the 32-round magazines it came with often had feeding issues. After WW2, most MP 40s were captured and distributed by the Allies to developing countries.
