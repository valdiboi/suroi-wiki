# Strategies
## Using
- Try to get up close to your opponent without losing too much health, then spam left click when you are close enough to your opponent.
  - Beware if they have a gun designed for close range combat, such as the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues).

## Countering
- If you see a player who has a K-Bar and is intrested in attacking you with it, stay at a distance and gun them down.
